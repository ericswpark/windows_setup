# Windows 10 setup scripts

These are the scripts I use to set up a new Windows machine.

## IMPORTANT

Windows restricts running PowerShell scripts by default. To relax this policy, you MUST run:

  Set-ExectutionPolicy AllSigned

in a PowerShell prompt. If you do not run this, the script will fail.
